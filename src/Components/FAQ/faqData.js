      question: "What is a waiver application?",
      answer: "If taxpayers in Kenya fail to pay their taxes or file returns by the specified deadlines, they may be subject to penalties and interest charges as per the law. These penalties and interest are considered as taxes payable. However, taxpayers can request the Commissioner to waive such penalties and interest. It's important to note that this provision only applies to penalties and interest, and the principal tax must be paid in full. The process of applying for the remission of penalties and interest is known as a waiver application, which the Commissioner may approve fully or partially based on the justification and evidence provided. It's worth noting that penalties and interest charged under fraud or tax evasion are not eligible for waiver consideration."
